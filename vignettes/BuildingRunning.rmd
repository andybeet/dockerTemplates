## Background

* Linux servers and their [specs](https://www.st.nmfs.noaa.gov/confluence/display/NECIT/Linux+Servers+at+the+NEFSC).

* The first two servers have podman and docker installed respectively.

* You will need an account set up for you (by ITD) to use either

* Both podman and docker operate in an almost identical way. You can just switch the word podman for docker and vice versa in any proceeding examples

* You will need to use VPN and log in to one of the servers, preferably using powershell (windows) or terminal (mac, linux)

* ssh username@server.noaa.nefsc.gov

## Build an run

* Copy/write `Dockerfile` in root directory

* Build Docker image 

  > docker build -t test_image .
  
* Run container

  > docker run -dp 8787:8787 -e PASSWORD=cheeky test_image
  
* Log in. Open a web browser and go to serverURL:8787. Username = `rstudio`, password = `cheeky`
